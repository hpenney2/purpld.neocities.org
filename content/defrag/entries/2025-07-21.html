<p>Aww, it was inevitable, wasn't it?</p>
<p>Yeah, it's finally a blog section. ;w;</p>
<p>
  Welcome to the
  <img class="inlineImg" src="/img/defrag_256.png" aria-hidden="true" /><span
    class="code boldText"
    >DEFRAG ZONE</span
  >! Ideally, this will service as I guess a bit more of a "formal" space to
  preserve and record my thoughts and whatnot. I keep a lot of my journaling
  (i.e. random notes in not very particular places) to myself, so I find it may
  be helpful to talk about some of that online. Or not. I'm not sure yet, but
  we'll see if I actually keep this up or not lol.
</p>
<p>
  Fun Fact! The origin of the "defrag" name is in reference to the feeling of
  having fragmented identities as it was an issue I was trying to figure out and
  research. I was originally going to frame this section as something specific
  to that, but it seemed too personal and specific so I decided on a
  blog/journal kinda thingy instead. Maybe one day, but not today.
</p>
<p>
  It's also, of course, a play into the idea of having to defragment disks. The
  icon is from <code>dfrgui.exe</code>! I liked the idea and it stays.
  <s>not to mention it's an excuse to add more to my website</s>
</p>
<p>
  I'm not sure. I have some trouble keeping track of thoughts (probably because
  I have a LOT of them lol), so it helps to write them down. Or type them, I
  guess. I'm a much faster typer ("typist"?) than a writer, that's for certain.
</p>
<p>
  That's kinda that! Expect some more stuff here soon, hopefully some fun,
  probably some less fun stuff too because the world is A̲̼̠̣̭̅̓̇́̕Ā̹̝̗̺͚͉̳̫̇̊͛̓̏̇̕͢͡͠A̶̛͚̳̟̮͚̅̀́̀̒ͅͅA̶̭̝̳̰͇͑̆̋̀́̉͆̒̕Ā̢̜̤͓̩͖̳̫̏̂̀̏͡͠ right now. Don't
  worry, I intend to add content warnings if some stuff ends up getting too
  serious, though! Hopefully I don't have to write about that kind of stuff any
  time soon though.
