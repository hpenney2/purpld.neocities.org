          <p>Aww, it was inevitable, wasn't it?</p>
          <p>Yeah, it's finally a blog section. ;w;</p>
          <p>
            Welcome to the
            <img
              class="inlineImg"
              src="/img/defrag_256.png"
              aria-hidden="true"
            /><span class="code boldText">DEFRAG ZONE</span>! Ideally, this will
            service as I guess a bit more of a "formal" space to preserve and
            record my thoughts and whatnot. I keep a lot of my journaling (i.e.
            random notes in not very particular places) to myself, so I find it
            may be helpful to talk about some of that online. Or not. I'm not
            sure yet, but we'll see if I actually keep this up or not lol.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fun Fact! The origin of the "defrag" name is in reference to the
            feeling of having fragmented identities as it was an issue I was
            trying to figure out and research. I was originally going to frame
            this section as something specific to that, but it seemed too
            personal and specific so I decided on a blog/journal kinda thingy
            instead. Maybe one day, but not today.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's also, of course, a play into the idea of having to defragment
            disks. The icon is from <code>dfrgui.exe</code>! I liked the idea
            and it stays.
            <s>not to mention it's an excuse to add more to my website</s>
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm not sure. I have some trouble keeping track of thoughts
            (probably because I have a LOT of them lol), so it helps to write
            them down. Or type them, I guess. I'm a much faster typer
            ("typist"?) than a writer, that's for certain.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's kinda that! Expect some more stuff here soon, hopefully some
            fun, probably some less fun stuff too because the world is A̲̼̠̣̭̅̓̇́̕Ā̹̝̗̺͚͉̳̫̇̊͛̓̏̇̕͢͡͠A̶̛͚̳̟̮͚̅̀́̀̒ͅͅA̶̭̝̳̰͇͑̆̋̀́̉͆̒̕Ā̢̜̤͓̩͖̳̫̏̂̀̏͡͠
            right now. Don't worry, I intend to add content warnings if some
            stuff ends up getting too serious, though! Hopefully I don't have to
            write about that kind of stuff any time soon though.
