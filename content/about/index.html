                    <span class="boldText">programming</span> is my hobby and
                    passion which i've been into for many years (although i

                    i love tinkering and knowing <em>EXACTLY</em> how everything

                    it's also why i tend to end up getting involved in other
                    people's projects n stuffz

                i am a SUCKER for nostalgia and it almost always hits me like a
                TRUCK. if you show me
                <a href="https://www.webkinz.com/">Webkinz</a> or Nintendo DS or
                3DS stuff i will cry /j
                <br />
                sounds and music are <em>especially</em> triggers for nostalgia
                for some reason. for instance, songs that i used to listen to
                many years ago, or the sounds and ambiance of old Windows
                versions or the 3DS
              </li>
              <li>
                i often get anxious when sharing things about myself and my
                interests for some reason ;m;
                <br />
                this website is actually somewhat of an escape from that and
                allows me to express myself more freely and comfortably with
                most (but not all, unfortunately) of that anxiety only in the
                back of my mind instead of screaming
                <br />
                it's just more comfy on the internet for some reason, idk lol
              </li>
              <li>
                i love music and singing but i never let anybody hear me sing,
                embarrassment is a crime
