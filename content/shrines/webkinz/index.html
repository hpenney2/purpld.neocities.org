      <h2>Welcome to Webkinz&trade; World!</h2>
      <p>
        if you don't know, <span class="boldText">Webkinz</span> is a children's
        massively multiplayer online (MMO) game and one the first in the
        <a

        genre of games.
        <br />
        the original core idea was that you buy a plushie at the store, and it
        comes with a <span class="boldText">Secret Code</span> which you can use
        to adopt your pet in the virtual game, in
        <span class="boldText">Webkinz World</span> ! you keep your real and
        virtual plushies, where you can play with them and take care of them in
        the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        there, you got to build a home with as many rooms as you want (though i
        can't remember if its capped based on how many pets you have), feed and
        dress up your pet, play job minigames at the Employment Office for
        KinzCash, learn at the Kinzville Academy, mine for gems at the

          >Curio Shop</a
        >, and most importantly, play games at the
        <span class="boldText">Webkinz Arcade</span> ! (also for
        ₩&nbsp;KinzCash, of course)
        <br />
        there is actually literally so much content that i can't fit it all into
        this section lol
      </p>
      <h2>The Coolest Thing is Everything!</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="boldText">Webkinz</span> was an incredibly important part
        of my childhood. i started playing it when i was very little and oh my
        GOSH i was obsessed, and so was my family.
      </p>
      <p>
        my first Webkinz was technically the Minty Moose, but the one I remember
        the most and was most attached to was
        <span class="rainbow boldText">Rainbow</span>, my Tie Dyed Puppy!
        <img
          src="/img/webkinz/rainbow.png"
          alt="A screenshot of the modern Webkinz Classic game, showing a Tie Dyed Puppy named Rainbow. The heart meter is nearly full, the happiness meter is full, the food meter is slightly over half full, and the sleep meter is just under full."
          style="float: right; max-width: 15em"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        while i had many, many, <em>many</em> Webkinz, Rainbow has always been
        my favorite pet and i love him and cherish him greatly. why? i dont know
        lol, maybe just cause hes pretty, i always liked his design the most i
        think &gt;p&lt;
        <br />
        but, i did everything with him for the most part!
      </p>
      <p>
        i'm honestly kinda sad because all of my plushies are lost to time
        <s>
          (i.e. probably lost to rats in a storage unit which we never got them
          out of because of
          <span class="boldText">COMPLICATIONS</span>) </s
        >, but when i did have them, i still held Rainbow as my favorite &lt;3
        <br />
        if you know where to look, you could find my own versions of "Webkinz
        Hotel" videos on YouTube that i uploaded MANY years ago. (good luck,
        they're unlisted lol) they have a bunch of my Webkinz plushies in them!
      </p>
      <p>
        on that note, i did actually have a little bit of an obsession with
        Webkinz videos n stuff for a while. my favorite creator was
        <a href="//www.youtube.com/@TheSuperdog19" target="_blank"
          >TheSuperdog19</a
        >! he made skits and funny stuff!
      </p>
      <p>
        there was, of course, also Webkinz's official music videos, Kinz Tunes,
        which you could also watch and listen to in game. one of the one's i
        remember the most for some reason is
        <cite class="boldText">The Coolest Thing is Everything!</cite> which is
        also the namesake of this section!

      <p>
        much to my surprise, i found out in 2019 that Webkinz is actually still
        alive and to this day doing VERY well.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="boldText">Webkinz Next</span> is a new 3D version of the
          game (think Club Penguin Island), it's okay lol but it's been
          improving over the years honestly. they even brought the plushes back!
          though they look like Beanie Babies/Boos. still though, some are

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        you can still like, go play the game!

          >you can go play Webkinz right now!</a
        >
        do that! it's honestly still super fun and i get so much nostalgia from
        this awesome game. even better, it's free nowadays and you don't have
        even have to buy a plushie.
      </p>
      <p>
        so, yeah. i definitely see the game through a thick pair of nostalgia
        goggles just because, but i do think Webkinz genuinely holds up and i
        wish more kids today would experience the same feeling of logging in
        everyday, taking care of your pets, having fun, and playing the Wacky
        Log Out Carnival before you log out for now. it's nice knowing that the
        era isn't lost like some others, though, like Club Penguin or Amazing
        World.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ganz in general has been a huge part of my childhood, so expect
        something about Amazing World soon too!
      </p>
      <p>
        i HIGHLY recommend watching

        it's a very good watch and a nostalgia trip, and it's actually an
